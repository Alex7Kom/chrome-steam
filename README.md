# Steam for Chrome Apps

__IMPORTANT__ This is an experiment library wrapper, it might break in some unexpected way.

This is basically a set of tools and hacks to make [node-steam](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam) run as part of a Chrome App.

## Installation

```
npm install chrome-steam
```

or 

```
bower install chrome-steam
```

or just [download the latest version](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/chrome-steam/releases/latest) from Github.

## Usage

Include `dist/steam.js` or `dist/steam.min.js` in your Chrome App.

Then create an instance of `SteamClient`, call its `logOn` and assign event listeners.

```js
var bot = new Steam.SteamClient();
bot.logOn({
  accountName: 'username',
  password: 'password'
});
bot.on('loggedOn', function() { /* ... */});
```

Check out [node-steam docs](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam/tree/d92b12e0aa63cde3fa5433a93eafefb752f875cf#usage) for information about API.

Note that for your convenience `chrome-steam` exposes Buffer API as `Steam.Buffer` to use in your Chrome App, for example, for handing `shaSentryfile` to `Steam.logOn`.

Check out example to see how to use it if you are unsure.

## Example

`dist/` directory contains a basic example Chrome App. 

In Google Chrome load `dist` subdirectory as unpacked extension, then open `background.html` console and follow the instructions.

## Compile your own

Clone the repo, switch to its directory and do `npm install`.

Install `gulp` and `uglifyjs`, then run `npm run-script make` to compile the project.

## How it is done

* To bundle `node-steam` with all of its dependencies [browserify](http://browserify.org/) is used.

* `node-steam` requires `net.Socket` to function, and that's is why it can't be run in a regular web page or as part of an extension. This example uses [chrome-net](https://github.com/feross/chrome-net) module to utilize `sockets` from Chrome Apps API without changing any `node-steam` code. `sockets` permission is needed for Sockets Chrome API.

* Browser version of [ByteBuffer](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ByteBuffer.js) module uses Array Buffer which is incompatible with Node buffers. This example forces use of Node buffers version of ByteBuffer.

* Since there is no any actual access to file system in ChromeApps, simple `my-fs` and `my-process` substitute modules for `fs.readFileSync()`, `process.cwd()`, and `process.chdir()` are included. gulp reads all necessary files and creates a JSON file which is required by `my-fs`.

* `"https://api.steampowered.com/"` permission is needed for `webLogOn` to work.

Review `node_modules/`, `Gulpfile.js`, and `dist/manifest.json` to see how everything is done.
